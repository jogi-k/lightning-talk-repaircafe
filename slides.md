### First Repair Cafe in Switzerland :  

* A guy from Thun called Roger Fleury saw in 2013 the Repair-Cafes in the Netherlands 
* decided to organize something similiar at home. 
* being himself not a repair-guy he did not find others
* idea was not suceessful
* In 2014 he was contacted by the so called [Konsumentenschutz](https://www.konsumentenschutz.ch) 
* together they organized the very first Repair Cafe in Switzerland
* In Thun on 16-Aug-2014 (around 200 visitors , 71 objects, 44 repaired)
