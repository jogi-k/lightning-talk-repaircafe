* 2013: Roger Fleury from Thun saw Repair-Cafes in Netherlands 
* decided to organize something similiar at home. 
* being himself not a repair-guy, he did not find others
* idea was not suceessful
* In 2014 he was contacted by [Konsumentenschutz](https://www.konsumentenschutz.ch) 
* together : very first Repair Cafe in Switzerland
* In Thun on 16-Aug-2014 (around 200 visitors , 71 objects, 44 repaired)

# How ?

---

## Some principles everywhere

* Repair itself has to be free
* Repairer has to be volunteer
* No professionals 
* Material can be charged
* Cafe, Cake etc can be charged
* Guests are allowed to donate

---

## How it works I

* Guests come and bring their objects
* We have a lot of tools, but also:
* Repairers bring their tools
    * Some a pocket-knife 
    * some a car w/ electronic equipment
* While guests waiting: drink coffee, eat cake
* we try to limit the time to 30-40 mins

---

## How it works II

* Still best:
    * encourage guest to repair themselves
    * with help of repairer
* At least:
    * guests "have" to stay
    * Its **not** drop and come back later 
    * They need to tell the problem
    * And to say yes/no e.g. on opening/cracking ...

---


## Experimenting with structure I

* Introduced Repair-Evenening
    * For stuff where we had hope
    * but expected time >> 30-40 mins
    * or material was missing
    * some weeks later, w/o any guests, just nerds :-)

### Success, we kept that

---


## Experimenting with structure II

* Introduced two repair-queues 
    * One where the people were waiting 
    * One for people who didn't have time

### Fail !

---

## Why Fail ?

* Most guest did not know the basic principle
* We couldn't tell them how long to wait
* dropped their objects
* Repairers could not ask about the problem
* Repairers could not clarify when opening
* Unhappyness on all ends ... 

---

## Solution 

* Digitalised the process 
* Self-Registration of guests
* Registration-office operates Kanban-Board 
* Dashboard for guests with estimated waiting-time
* Kanban-Board for repairers
    * showing them the queue-length
    * "forcing" them to stop latest after 30-40 mins
* Web-based, [open-source](https://github.com/jogi-k/repaircafe) (Python, Flask, Bootstrap...)
* A lot of improvement-ideas ...
